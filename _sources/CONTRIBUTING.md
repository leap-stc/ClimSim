# Developer Guide for the website

## Jupter Book based website

Our [website](https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim/) is built with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)

### How to build the website locally

To mimic what [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-website.yml) does on GitHub, first copy the README and demo notebooks to the website directory.

```bash
cd website
cp -r ../demo_notebooks .
```

Create a local conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

activate the environment

```bash
conda activate climsim-docs-env
```

and run the following command to build the website locally

```bash
jupyter-book build .
```

The HTML content will be built in a folder called `_build` and can be viewed by opening the file `_build/html/index.html` in a browser.
