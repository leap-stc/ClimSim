# Quickstart

**Step 1**

The first step is to download the subsampled low-resolution real-geography version of the data [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/subsampled_low_res/tree/main). This contains subsampled and prenormalized data that was used for training, validation, and metrics for the ClimSim paper. It can be reproduced with the full version of the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/ClimSim_low-res) using the [preprocessing/create_npy_data_splits.ipynb](https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim/blob/main/preprocessing/create_npy_data_splits.ipynb) notebook.

Training data corresponds to **train_input.npy** and **train_target.npy**. Validation data corresponds to **val_input.npy** and **val_target.npy**. Scoring data (which can be treated as a test set) corresponds to **scoring_input.npy** and **scoring_target.npy**. We have an additional held-out test set that we will use for an upcoming online competition. Keep an eye out! ðŸ˜‰

**Step 2**

Install the `climsim_utils` python tools, by running the following code from the root of this repo:

```
pip install .
```

If you already have all `climsim_utils` dependencies (`tensorflow`, `xarray`, etc.) installed in your local environment, you can alternatively run:

```
pip install . --no-deps
```

**Step 3**

Train your model on the training data and validate using the validation data. If you wish to use something like a CNN, you will probably want to separate the variables into channels and broadcast scalars into vectors of the same dimension as vertically-resolved variables. Methods to do this can be found in the [climsim_utils/data_utils.py](https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim/blob/main/climsim_utils/data_utils.py) script.

**Step 4**

Evaluation time! Use the [evaluation/main_figure_generation.ipynb](https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim/blob/main/evaluation/main_figure_generation.ipynb) notebook to see how your model does! Use the **calc_MAE**, **calc_RMSE**, and **calc_R2** methods in the [climsim_utils/data_utils.py](https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim/blob/main/climsim_utils/data_utils.py) script to see how your model does on point estimates and use the calc_CRPS method to check how well-calibrated your model is if it's stochastic. ðŸ˜Š
