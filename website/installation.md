# Code Installation

For preprocessing and evaluation, please install the `climsim_utils` python tools, by running the following code from the root of this repo:

```

```

If you already have all `climsim_utils` dependencies (`tensorflow`, `xarray`, etc.) installed in your local environment, you can alternatively run:

```
pip install . --no-deps
```
